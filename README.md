# FlappyTurtle

Flappy Turtle was the final project that I submitted to the college board as part of my AP test in AP Computer Science Principles. The main thing that I learned from making this game was how to make sprites move to the left and then once they reach off screen they re-appear on the right side. I also figured out how to make a sprite jump up and then fall down (Turtle sprite) and then made it so that everytime it passed 2 other sprites (Straw sprites) it would add 1 point to the total score.
